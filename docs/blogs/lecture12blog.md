# Gestalt Principles in My Shirt

In class today, we took a look at the Gestalt principles for good visual design. In particular, we took a look at how figure and ground played into visual design, and an example provided was the "TIE" image that made everyone go Ohhhhhhh.

This led me to instantly think of a shirt my mom had bought for me back in high school. Now, I've had this shirt for several years, and I always thought it was a pretty cool shirt, as it had a really interesting design with a bunch of different shapes. I frequently wore this shirt, and no one had said anything about it. However, when I got to MIT, my friend pointed out that these shapes actually weren't just shapes.

Here's my shirt below, if you can figure out what it says I will give you my praise because I didn't notice it for almost 3 years. Even now, knowing what it says, it's STILL hard for me to see it.

My friend in college one day laughed at my shirt, saying "I love how your shirt just says Saturdays Saturdays Saturdays". I was so confused, I didn't have a shirt that said Saturdays. I looked down, and couldn't see it either. I had to get my friend to take a picture of me, then I had to squint at it to finally see the words Saturdays Saturdays Saturdays. 

After the most recent lecture, I finally realized why this shirt had stumped me for so long. The background of the shirt is extremely ambiguous. Since the rest of the shirt is white, we automatically see the design as one big block. When we see some sort of rectangular block design, we tend to see the color in the edges as the background, which made me see the black as the background, and the gray as just interesting shapes on top of the background (for the first block). Furthermore, even if the black is instead the foreground, it is difficult to see letters as there is a lack of consistency. The biggest consistency break is the S's in the saturdays, as they are the only ones really signified by lines, as they don't have more background on the left or right to imply them having a thickness like the other letters in the word. Also, the S's themselves are not consistent, as the left S has black to cover the right side of the S and the right S has black to cover the left side instead. This really makes it difficult to see the S's in general, and maybe causes the person looking to see "aturday" only, which doesn't seem like a word, and causes people like me to not even think that it could be a word. 

In conclusion, my shirt is very bad at upholding the Gestalt principles, but I still think it is a cool shirt, and maybe will wear it to class one day if people would like.
