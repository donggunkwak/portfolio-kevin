# Response to Ashi Kamra's Blog

Hi Ashi, I found your [blog post](https://ashi-kamra.github.io/portfolio-akamra/blogs/blog1.html) very thought-provoking about how dangerous technology can be. To follow up on your point about utilizing new technology like AI to combat negative effects of big technology, I think that even if the new technology is made to act as a positive influence, advancing a field like AI could cause bad actors to use these advancements to do harm. For example, a current issue I thought of was AI art, and how that is being used to steal and discredit artists' works and call it their own. AI image generation and the technology used for it like transformers were definitely not made with this in mind, and instead for more positive things like classifying images or providing artists support, yet a few bad actors has made this new technology into a new societal issue. 

This topic got me to think about "Black Mirror", a show about how technology can have very extreme negative impacts. I haven't watched too much of the show, but an episode I watched "Hated in the Nation", has a great example of how technology can potentially be misused. In the episode, there are basically robot bees made to pollenate the earth and maintain its ecosystem after the bees have gone extinct. However, one person basically hacks the bees to make them into weapons. I won't spoil the rest of the episode, so I recommend watching it on Netflix in your free time! 

Technology definitely can have very detrimental effects, even if they were made to help others.
