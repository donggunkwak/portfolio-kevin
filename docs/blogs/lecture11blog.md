# IPhone Assistive Access
In class, we discussed about pleasant and calm technology, specifically with IPhones with their grayscale filter and focus modes. We even looked at the light phone, which is specifically designed to just have the most basic functionalities. After discussing all of this, I was surprised when we ended up not covering IPhone's assistive access feature, which is a very similar concept to the light phone.

This feature, introduced in IOS 16 in 2023, was made for people with cognitive disabilities. According to apple, it makes it so that "onscreen items are bigger, features are more focused, and itâ€™s easier to navigate and understand what actions are possible", with the purpose being to "offer ways for people to navigate iPhone and communicate using visuals rather than text". The feature is meant to be set up by some family member or caregiver for the person using the phone, to choose apps suited to the person's needs.

As you can see above, these are two different possible layouts for Assistive Access phones, with whatever apps chosen to be there. The buttons are large in both cases, and are easily distinguishable by the boxes and gray space between each button. Furthermore, the text is always close to the icons themselves, and easily large enough to see, giving accessible options for those who maybe aren't good with recognizing icons, or those who have trouble reading. It very well follows gestalt principles of grouping with this spacing The layout is much more pleasant and simple than the normal IPhone layout as well, with there not being a very distracting backgrounds, notification indicators, or folders.

I think buttons are much more clear than the normal iphone apps, even shown here. We discussed about how IPhone texting had a lot of buttons that weren't as clear they were buttons, like the cancel button, the two plus buttons that do different actions, or the globe and microphone buttons at the bottom of the keyboard. Here, we see that the buttons to press have very distinct borders and shadows. However, I do think this example is a step too far in the helping accessibility direction, as the possible user interactions are much more limited now, only being able to communicate with emojis. 

The photos and music app are much better at retaining the neccessary implementation while focusing on design, as these are both very simple apps. The photos are well separated, with no other distracting information, and the music app just has the songs and a distinct play/pause button. Furthermore, both apps have the same back button at the bottom, keeping the layout consistent and easy to use. My one critique is that it doesn't do so for the texting app as well, and to be honest, I'm not even sure how to exit the texting app from that page shown there.

I think that the Assistive Access is a really cool idea that Apple has implemented, and it really helps as evidence that they're focusing more on design nowadays. Working towards helping an underserved audience with features like this is definitely a step in the right direction of eliminating bias from software developers. However, there are still definitely some improvements to be made with the design. My biggest criticism is how unknown this feature is, which is why I assume it wasn't mentioned in Lecture. It is a setting that you must go out of your way to find in the settings app, with several steps necessary to activate it.
