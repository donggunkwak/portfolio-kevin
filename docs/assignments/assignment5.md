## Heuristic Evaluation

### Usability Criteria

**Efficiency**
- For correctness voting, if a user wants to look at the results, they have to go into the voting part of the app, which seems inefficient. 
- However, if we change this, this may affect the pleasantness, as it adds in more text on the screen for distractions.
- Creating posts and creating comments are simple and efficient, as they just require one click to get to, and some text input and a press of a "post" button, only needing around 3 clicks in total.
- However, this might interfere with the safety of the system, as it is so easy to post something that it might be easy to accidentally comment or post something. Perhaps some sort of confirmation button could be something to look into.

**Accessibility**
- I enjoy how most of my features just require button presses, as they are easily accessible. 
- However, I did have it as the correctness voting feature to have to hold it down at first, mostly because it's easier to let go of the button to stop looking at that screen for efficiency purposes. But this causes difficulties perhaps for users with motor disabilities, so scrapping that interaction and instead using just a button press might be a good idea.
- Furthermore, for people with motor disabilities, it may be difficult to press some of the smaller buttons like in the submit verification or logout buttons. For the logout button, I can actually see this as a good thing, as you don't want to accidentally log out too often. 
- However, I could also make it larger and with a confirmation button instead, also allowing for users to make more mistakes to help the safety of the app.

### Physical Heuristics

**Gestalt Principles**
- I feel as though for my home pages, posting, and comments, there is a good use of white space and lines to separate regions. 
- For the register page, a better use of grouping with white space could be used for the text boxes to group password and confirm password together and separate from username and name.
- For the account page, I believe having more distinction between the bottom bar and the posts at the bottom would be a good idea, as right now they seem to blend together. However, this would also affect the pleasantness if done without caution.
- Also for accounts, having a clearer divide/section for the type of verification received would be a better idea, also to make it seem more important.

**Mapping**
- Having multiple ways to go into posts (Buttons on top saying short, long, blog, and also just the video thumbnails) seems confusing, as the top buttons almost seem like categorizations on the thumbnail page, so maybe I can change it to that, or remove that functionality.
- Furthermore, the short, long, blog buttons being on other pages as well may serve to be somewhat confusing, as it feels like they don't relate to the page or may be a different feature on that page (like posting a post, a user might think of it as the type of post)
- For my correctness voting, having just the check mark might make it seem like it's voting correct only, which may be confusing for the user. Instead, I would probably need some sort of other icon.

### Linguistic Level

**Speak a user's language**
- All places where users can have input are labeled well.
- However, for the upload post, I believe that the "note" might be quite confusing, and instead changing it to have different sections to determine the type of post might be a better idea
- I believe that all the buttons that perform an action are also very clear on what action they would perform.

**Consistency**
- I made sure to use very similar icons to those of other social media apps to make it very clear on the button functionalities.
- I also like that my bottom bar was always consistently present, so users would never get too lost
- I think something I dislike about the consistency actually, is how similar the post and verification submission page are. This could serve to be confusing to the user on what page it is, and instead perhaps some color changes would suffice to serve as a distinction.
