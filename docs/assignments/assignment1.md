## Interview Prep
**Hunch:**

How can social media be used to further educational content, not just specific to academics? I would like to build a social media app with differing media types, including blogs, long form videos, and short form videos that focus on teaching different topics.
People to interview:

**Daniel Kwak - 3rd year med student**

Describe day of a 3rd year med student. After, ask how it differs from 1st and 2nd year. How does he use social media to learn about medicine? Give me a specific example of when you used social media to learn a topic for medicine. Is social media good for making connections? Or learning about opportunities for med students? How is social media at being a distraction and how to prevent that? If itâ€™s a big distraction, how long does he use it a day? Do medical students even use social media much? What social medias do his friends use, and what for?

**Max Wang - started working full time at a quant company, also a musician**

Describe day in life of a quant. What do you do for work? Are there is a lot of info from social media about market trends and such? How was social media for finding a job in quant? How often do you use social media to try to learn new musical ideas? Tell me about a musical idea you learned from social media and how you worked to implement it? Does social media help in your work? Are music educational videos actually helpful? Or do they fly by your head? What form of videos seems to work?

## Reports
### Daniel Report
First, I asked Daniel about his typical day as a 3rd year medical student. He explained how much it was like working a job, as 3rd years were very rotation based, with his day starting at 5am and ending at 5pm. Unsurprisingly, the typical day of a medical student seemed extremely busy, which is why it wasn't too surprising to hear that Daniel said that he used social media mostly for stress relief, with a lot of doctor influencers mostly posting funny reels instead of informational ones. He did state that there was still a lot of information on instagram reels, but it wasn't as useful. "There are a lot of 'fake' doctors on instagram reels, and it'd be easy for new med students to get confused. But it's on the person watching to have a good sense of judgement." I was surprised as I had not really thought of this, since I assumed that all the reels with false information from doctors might be discredited and not get as popular. However, I realized it made sense as there were definitely a lot of people who weren't studying medicine that would watch these videos as well. 

Just as I thought that medical students didn't have much of a need for social media, we started to talk about long term content, such as Youtube, where he told me that he actually had learned a lot from it. For example, it helped to learn how to do sutures or tying knots for surgeries. More interesting, however, was the fact that he listened to a podcast called "divine intervention". This podcast was from a 4th year medical student who just gave lectures. He said the podcast "speedruns through everything possible on the exam", and because of this, "all medical students would listen to it". He described listening to it on the drive both to and back from the hospital. It seemed that medical students would watch or listen to a lot more long form content. However, he also said that reading papers was too difficult as it took up a lot of time and attention. "It's nice to do things passively as medical students have no time." Then he went on to talk about a tool medical students had been using because of long papers: "All residents have been using this new AI tool called Open Evidence, which is essentially ChatGPT for medical students. You just ask it about a topic and it will pull articles and summarize them." It really seemd like long form content was useful for medical students to learn, but it couldn't be too long. We then talked about how connections are formed in the field, and it seemed to be a lot of cold emails after doing your own research on the field and the experts there. Medical students had no "LinkedIn", or no social media platform to find connections. It was difficult to find interest groups as well, since there were just some on campus, who just made posts on GroupMe. "It'd be nice if there was a streamlined platform for these". 

### Max Report

Max had just started working last Tuesday (9/3/24) as a junior quantitative researcher, and did not have enough experience to know exactly what his job entailed. Furthermore, he wasn't allowed to disclose much about his work to protect trading strategies. When asking about how social media was used in quantitative finance, he said that it wasn't really used, neither in the algorithms themselves or from people posting about the field in social media. Instead he expressed that it was mostly just used as a stress relief at his job. It seemed like social media was perhaps not a great way to know more about fields where information was protected such as quantitative finance. Instead, we opted to talk about music and how social media is used there. Max used mostly instagram and youtube as his main outlets of social media. He didn't really use them as a tool to seek out information, but instead he felt as if information came to him "more out of the blue" from social media. He said he mostly watched short form content, and that Instagram was more educational- "Instagram has really fast music points" -  while Youtube shorts were more entertaining. 

However, even though Instagram was educational, he said "less than 5%" was actually learned, and that was only a week after when he saved the videos. The biggest issue was getting started and actually practicing: "Opening up a DAW is hard, it takes a lot of activation energy". He said he had a lot more success when he could do it easily, like if there was just a piano next to him. For example, he talked about a youtube channel called OpenStudioJazz, where they would go through some simple chord progressions, or when he saw some singing technique videos, he would try them instantly. He then explained how long form videos were mostly just from youtube, but he had not so much recently been watching them. When he did watch them though, he watched video game music theory videos by 8 bit music theory. It seemed as though short form videos were better for spreading information, but it needed to be easy to practice what was being shown, or else the user would end up going to the next reel. We also ended up talking about how he used social media for other information. For example, he would add exercises to his repertoire that he saw on instagram, or send his dad posture fixing videos. He even said that he gave his girlfriend a skull crushers workout that she regularly does now. He also used to watch a lot of self-improvement content. Overall though, he would use social media just for entertainment, like watching video games, suggesting that social media must be entertaining for an active user base.

## Design Opportunities
- Providing Credentials on Accounts

For a place where many young, easily influenced teenagers and young adults will be getting a lot of information from, it is very easy to get false information from the internet and social media. In order to make information more trustworthy, I'm envisioning a way for professionals to verify their credentials on their accounts. In Daniel's interview, he stated the importance of how much false information there is from "fake" doctor influencers, but students could get less confused if they saw information from a reputable source, like a qualified doctor with a verified medical degree. However, this comes into question how this would be validated.

- Interest Groups

This would be some sort of page where people with similar interests would talk, ask questions, and post videos/pictures about the topic on. The idea would be somewhat similar to reddit, yet would have an easier function of chatting with the people in the same group. The goal of this would be to make it easier to learn things in the topic you're interested in, as people would only post educational things about that topic, and you could ask members for help and resources. This would also make it easier to receive content that you want to receive, as you're essentially "signing up" for the kind of videos you would get. Daniel says that something streamlined like this would be nice in his interview, as campus Interest groups exist, but are more in person and just announced on his medical school's GroupMe.

- A Connection System

Combining the two above together (Interest Groups and credentials), this would work as a way to connect people in the same field, similar to an application such as linkedIn, yet with a little less professionalism and more ease of access, since it is easy to just look at the professionals in your interest group. This would really help medical students like Daniel, who have to do a lot of outside research to find professionals he can shadow.

- AI Integration for summarized content

The goal of this opportunity would be to use AI to shorten content to make it easier to read, view, or understand. This could include making a very short summary of a video so the person could know if it was worth it to watch, or cutting parts of the video to just the most interesting or important parts. This helps catch people's attention, as Max and Daniel both talked about how their attention spans were not long enough to watch/read long form content. This would cut on time while getting more views and more information out. This is already somewhat being done with OpenEvidence in the medical field, which Daniel mentioned, but could be further enhanced to videos and posts made on this social media, not just papers. This AI generated short form content would then also have their longer form counterparts available to look at. This also could make a large difference in actually implementing what is watched, since you would have a summary of the video to look at so you wouldn't have to rewatch parts of the video again to understand the point.

- Different post voting system

Instead of just having a like dislike system, perhaps a system being more informative on how you felt the video was would be helpful. For example, having a voting system for "entertaining"/"engaging" and "informative" separated would be good. This is because the current hunch of the project is to work as an educational tool, but both Daniel and Max said that they use social media as a stress reliever and as a source of entertainment. This new voting system might be able to help better recommend posts that are working towards the goal of the educational social media tool I envisioned, while still keeping users engaged, but not to the point where it just becomes like other social media sites.
