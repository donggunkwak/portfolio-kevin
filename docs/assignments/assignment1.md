## Interview Prep
**Hunch:**

How can social media be used to further educational content, not just specific to academics? I would like to build a social media app with differing media types, including blogs, long form videos, and short form videos that focus on teaching different topics.
People to interview:

**Daniel Kwak - 3rd year med student**

Describe day of a 3rd year med student. After, ask how it differs from 1st and 2nd year. How does he use social media to learn about medicine? Give me a specific example of when you used social media to learn a topic for medicine. Is social media good for making connections? Or learning about opportunities for med students? How is social media at being a distraction and how to prevent that? If itâ€™s a big distraction, how long does he use it a day? Do medical students even use social media much? What social medias do his friends use, and what for?

**Max Wang - started working full time at a quant company, also a musician**

Describe day in life of a quant. What do you do for work? Are there is a lot of info from social media about market trends and such? How was social media for finding a job in quant? How often do you use social media to try to learn new musical ideas? Tell me about a musical idea you learned from social media and how you worked to implement it? Does social media help in your work? Are music educational videos actually helpful? Or do they fly by your head? What form of videos seems to work?
