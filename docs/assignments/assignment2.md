# Brainwave
## Description of Audience
The intended audience for this app are students/people who are trying to learn different skills. This means people who are in high school, college, med school, law school, etc. Or people who would like to hone their skills or learn new ones such as music, art, how to program a website, blow glass, etc. 

The app will be focused on really being an outlet to learn and connecting with those who are learning the same thing as our user, beyond other apps that are mostly just for entertainment. However, it will still be entertaining as to not become similar to websites/apps that are just purely educational/professional. It's main goal is to help those who are on social media for a lot of their day be able to learn something out of their scrolling, instead of just watching funny videos.

Fact-checking
On December 16, 2019, Facebook announced it would expand its fact-checking programs towards Instagram, by using third-party fact-checkers organizations false information is able to be identified, reviewed and labeled as false information. Content when rated as false or partly false is removed from the explore page and hashtag pages, additionally content rated as false or partly false are labeled as such. With the addition of Facebook fact-checking program came the use of image matching technology to find further instances of misinformation. If a piece of content is labeled false or partly false on Facebook or Instagram then duplicates of such content will also be labeled as false.

Fact checking by Instagram and Facebook: Would this be a good idea to implement along with verified professionals?

Leaderboard on apps: Could some sort of leaderboard help incentivize using the app? Perhaps counting for how many things you practice or learn.

Apple Health social media upsell if youâ€™re too active: Although this is a parody/joke, I think doing the thing it is parodying, which would be asking to take a break if you're scrolling too much, may be good, but instead of quitting the app entirely, maybe just instead switching to long form content.

Different like types on facebook: Can we perhaps utilize a similar strategy, but instead use it to also help filter what kind of content it is with different reaction types?

Instagram Quizzes: Can we use this to have more quizzes that will actually work as some sort of quick testing tool?

## Feature Ideas 
(GPT used for some idea inspiration)

1. *Automatic Playlist Maker:* After saving some media, you will be able to sort based on a specific topic and only videos/posts that include that topic will be included in an automatic playlist. This allows quick finding and sorting of videos you found particularly useful. It will also be for types of content as well (short, long, podcast, paper, etc.)
2. *Professional Verification:* Professionals can send in their certifications privately so as to get verified as a professional on the app, showing who has a trustworthy background to users.
3. *Fact Checking:* Have both an AI generated fact checking, and a user generated fact checking ability (done with different reaction types), to help give more trust towards informational posts.
4. *Interest Groups:* Groups of people who are trying to learn the same thing, made specifically to find mentors and those who are learning besides you in your learning journey. Different to sites like reddit as communication between users in the same group will be encouraged more than posting like reddit.
5. *Post Reaction Types:* Adding more than just the like and dislike button, instead with a bunch of other reaction types such as "correct/false", "entertaining/not entertaining", "informational/not informational", etc. Will help allow users to judge the videos they watch to get better, more correct information, or filter for posts.
6. *More Interesting Profiles:* Profiles that tell more about the person. What their interest groups are, a ranking of their top interests, etc. This is along with other basic parts of their profile, like the posts they've made and other things.
7. *Post quizzes:* Users can make a short quiz (3ish multiple choice questions) at the end of their post giving questions about their posts. A count of how many quizzes a user gets right can be tallied.
8. *Quiz leaderboards:* Creates leaderboards (daily, weekly, monthly) on how many quizzes you solved correctly. Goes directly off of the Post quizzes idea, and incentivizes these quizzes to be done.
9. *Achievements and Titles:* Achievements related to these quizzes (eg. solve 5 quizzes 100% in a row!) and titles (eg. Quiz master) to reward solving these quizzes. Achievements and titles can also be rewarded to the people who make quizzes, and make good ones (which can be based on the voting system).
10. *AI Live Summary:* An AI tool that live summarizes any video posts for you and puts it on the side. Helpful for informational videos since you can read the summary as you watch the video or after you watch the video, in case you missed some information you don't have to go through and find the part you want to watch again.
11. *Mental Health Content Switch:* If watching short form videos for too long, suggests changing to long form content, either long videos or podcasts, incentivizing you to watch more educational content or listen to podcasts while you do something else. Different approach to mental health suggestions, as many just end up getting ignored anyways.
12. *Content Suggestion Filter:* Allows users to choose what kind of content is suggested to them on their feed. Options would include "content you think I want to watch", "content from my Interest groups", "content from new topics", "short videos", "podcasts", etc. Gives the user more freedom and customization.
13. *Content Search Filter:* Similar to Content Suggestion Filter, but specific to what you're searching up, so you would only be given podcasts, etc.
14. *Mentor Matchmaking:* Algorithm that matches users with others that can be mentors. Can choose based on goals, preferred learning styles, and skill level.
15. *Collaborative Resource Pages:* Pages that have links to videos and other resources. Admins of these pages can allow people to make changes or suggest changes to add more resources.
16. *Skill level chats:* Allows users to filter themselves into different skill level chats. This way, you can talk to people of a similar skill level. However, this doesn't stop someone from asking people with higher skill levels questions.
17. *AI Tutor:* This AI tutor will give you tips on what to learn, based on what content you've been consuming and your progress. It will also suggest videos and other content on what to learn, specifically finding content on what it has suggested.
18. *New Skill Discovery:* Suggests new skills to learn based on what you've been interested in/what skills you have been learning. Made for people trying to pick up a new hobby.
19. *Time Capsules:* Users can upload time capsule posts, which will be some sort of record of their current progress in time (a video showing their skill, etc). Then, they will be unable to view it for a set amount of time (one month, one year, etc.), and after that time they will be notified on it. Then, they can post another post of their current progress, and reflect on their growth.
20. *Anonymous Feedback option:* Have the option to receive anonymous feedback on a post, to see where your skill level is at and what you could improve in.

## VSD Analysis
1. Specifically for stakeholders, the prompt of non-targeted use could very much apply to feature idea 20, Anonymous Feedback Option. The internet already has this sense of anonymity, as you could easily make a burner account and post whatever you want. It is easy to spread hate this way, and although this anonymous feedback option is made to be honest, it could very much be extremely negative towards mental health. Some solutions I can think of besides just removing the option entirely is to do something similar to Twitter, where AI automatically detects hateful posts, or perhaps an option to report comments which, if found to be hurtful, would have the commenter revealed. 
2. For widespread use in pervasiveness, I think that, if millions of users ended up using this app, using the achievement and titles feature as a realy way to qualify skills would be an interesting approach. Of course, this would perhaps mean that there would need to be a shift towards real qualifications for achievements. For this, longer exams or certification tests could be administered. Or, perhaps, to piggyback off of the Professional Verification idea, needing to get these skills verified through outer sources.
3. I think there are a lot of long term health and well-being benefits (time criteria) for my app. First of all, the app is centered around making long term life changes by learning new skills. One specific feature that promote well-being include the time capsules, as long term users will use this feature to see their own growth and boost happiness and confidence. I think this feature could be extended further, to have regular checkup posts, with many encouraging messages sent to the user for sticking with their skill and growing. It could even encourage others to post encouraging comments on others' posts.
4. For crossing national borders, I think this sort of app can very easily fall short as a lot of informational posts can be stuck behind a language barrier. One specific feature I thought of was the post quizzes, as the information on the posts will not be understandable in a different language, but also the quizzes will just not be answerable. So, to combat this, I think having a new feature where people can translate the post and post quizzes to receive progress towards an achievement would be a good idea. Sort of similar to a remix on Tiktok, where people remake the post in their own language, with the other post as a reference, or just a translation option like subtitles.
5. For user experience of values, I think skill level chats could have a very negative effect, causing some sort of hierarchy feeling. Although the design was just to find people of similar skill level to talk to, I can very much see it easily being these highly exclusive chats where those of higher skill level look down on those of lower skill level. I believe that users should feel included, and feel no pressure to "compete", and instead just be able to freely talk to others to learn. I do see a world where removing this feature may be the only way to go, but I'm thinking it may be possible to instead change this to a more smaller set, where you will be matched with a few users that have the similar skill level as you, without telling you what skill level this is.

Sorry about the poor handwriting. I think something I want to make more clear about the flow is the holding down the button to see the votes. The current storyboard doesn't have an indication on what buttons can be held down, and I want to make some sort of indication for this. I also would like to maybe have a caption for each one at the top, but am worried about spacing.
